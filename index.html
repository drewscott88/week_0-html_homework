            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My name is Andrew Borda, Im a 33 year old man that lived in Palm Springs as a child but have had many other homes since then. I currently
                 live in the city of Los Angeles with my girlfriend Faith and our dog Lilo. The reason why I'm intrerested in this class is because for
                  one I've always been very interested in learning more about computers in general, and two I'm simply in search of a better quality of 
                  life. I was release from prison almost a year ago after being there for 12 years, which inevitably had a major impact on my life
                   however, I'm really looking forward to putting behind me. I have a few hobbies that I enjoy doing when I have <q>free time</q>,
                    which doesn't seem to come very often these days.</p>
                    <ul><h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                    <li>Hiking</li>

              <h2>My Dreams</h2> 
              <p>I would like to become a web developer, or work with AI technology and travel the country and some day the world and see all the places 
                and do all the things that I never thought would be possible. I felt stuck in one pllace for so long and I guess feel the need now to
                 overcompensate for all the things I missed out on in life. I love to be be in nature and and experience all the things it has to offer.
                  Last but not least I'd love to see the Rams and Lakers to win some more championships!</p>
